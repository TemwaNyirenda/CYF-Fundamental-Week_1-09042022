      Hello, my name is Temwa Nyirenda. I was born in South Africa and have spent the majority of my life here. Both my parents were born in Malawi, and that is where the majority of my extended family still live. I am the middle child and have one older brother and one younger sister. I’m extremely close to my family and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. 
    </p>

        In my spare time, I enjoy watching k-dramas and anime. I also enjoy playing chess. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chess.com/">chess.com</a> (username @MasterBossLord if you would like to play a game). Also in my spare time, I enjoy playing squash. I’ve been playing squash on and off for child (it was a family pastime), but I’m pretty sure I’d still be considered close to a novice, I’m not that good. Lastly, I’m trying to learn Chichewa, my mother’s mother tongue. Chichewa is also known as Nyanja and is spoken in Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, but if you’ve never heard of it, the video to the right is a music video in Chichewa.

    <p>
      I think that the ability to program a computer is really fascinating. I want to be able to build computer programs and know how to design how they will look to the people who use those programs. Personally, I wouldn’t call myself artistic, but being able to use code to make something aesthetically pleasing as well as efficient and useful for the end-user is something that I want to learn how to do.

         What I hope to gain from the CodeYourFuture course is the skills needed to start a professional job as a developer. I need practical experience in coding and I know that I would gain this by going through this program. There is also the added benefit that CodeYourFuture is both flexible and part-time, so I know that I’ll be able to stay on top of the assignments needed and still be able to work.
